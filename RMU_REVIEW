The Tabular class implements all requirements for accessing, adding/deleting and modifying tabular data. This can be evidenced through the tests in test/tabular_test.rb, which test the requirements with a simple data set.

The tests are ordered in groups for easier perusal:

1. Initialization with and without data
2. Accessing table data by column, row or both
3. Row manipulation (adding, deleting, inserting, appending and transforming)
4. Column manipulation (adding, deleting, inserting, appending and transforming)
5. Filtering rows and columns by certain criteria

s1-exam-data.yaml has been transformed by the code in test/manipulate_complex_data.rb and the yaml file can be found at 
test/s1-exam-data-transformed.yaml
